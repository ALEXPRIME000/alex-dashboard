## 🔥 Questions for You (Kabundji)

### 1. Real-Time Dashboard Updates
Should I create a background service that:
- Updates `status.json` every heartbeat?
- Tracks actual API token usage from logs?
- Logs every task I complete?

**Effort:** 1-2 hours | **Value:** High visibility

### 2. Automated Daily Reports
Want me to send you a WhatsApp summary each evening?
- Tasks completed
- Tokens used / cost
- Pending items
- Next day priorities

**Effort:** 30 min | **Value:** Stay informed passively

### 3. Multi-Agent Dashboard
When subagents are running, should the dashboard show:
- All active agents and their status?
- Task delegation flow?
- Per-agent costs?

**Effort:** 2-3 hours | **Value:** Full visibility into the pyramid

### 4. Cost Alerts
Set up alerts when:
- Daily spend exceeds threshold (e.g., $5)?
- Approaching monthly budget?
- Unusual activity detected?

**Effort:** 1 hour | **Value:** Budget protection

### 5. Calendar Integration
Should I proactively:
- Check your Google Calendar?
- Remind you of upcoming events?
- Block focus time for deep work?

**Effort:** 2 hours | **Value:** Never miss meetings

### 6. Email Monitoring
Should I check your inbox and:
- Alert for urgent emails?
- Draft responses for routine ones?
- Summarize daily email digest?

**Effort:** Setup already done | **Value:** Inbox zero

2. **Cost Alerts** - Prevent surprises. Set a $10/day warning threshold.

3. **Real-Time Dashboard Updates** - Make the dashboard actually live, not static.
