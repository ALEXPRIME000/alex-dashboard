# 3. FACEBOOK/META ADVERTISING — CHEAPEST STRATEGIES

## Budget Optimization

### Lowest Cost Ad Types

2. **Engagement Campaigns** — €0.01-0.05 per engagement
3. **Video Views** — €0.01-0.03 per view (huge reach)

### Expensive (Avoid for Now)
- Lead generation (€2-15 per lead)
- Conversions (€5-50+ per conversion)
- App installs (€1-5 per install)

## Cheapest Strategy: Video + Retargeting

**Phase 1: Reach (€5/day)**
- Create 60-90 second value video (tips, showcase, how-to)
- Run video view campaign
- Target: France, age 25-55, interests: architecture, real estate, business

**Phase 2: Retarget (€3/day)**
- Retarget people who watched 50%+ of video
- Show them testimonials, case studies, or offer
- Much cheaper than cold audiences (warm leads)

## Budget Breakdown

| Monthly Budget | Daily Split | Expected Reach |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| €100 | €3.30/day | 10,000-30,000 |
| €200 | €6.60/day | 25,000-60,000 |
| €300 | €10/day | 40,000-100,000 |

## Quick Wins

1. **Boost best-performing organic posts** (€5-10, huge reach)
2. **Use Reels/Stories** — 50% cheaper than feed ads
3. **Test in low-competition hours** — 6-9 AM, lower CPM
4. **Exclude expensive placements** — Audience Network, Messenger

# 8. INVESTMENT & WEALTH STRATEGY

## Disclaimer
*I am an AI assistant, not a licensed financial advisor. The following is educational information, not financial advice. Always consult a qualified professional before making investment decisions.*

## Wealth Building Framework

### Foundation (Build First)
1. **Emergency Fund** — 3-6 months expenses
2. **Eliminate high-interest debt**
3. **Insurance** — Life, health, professional liability

### Growth (Once Foundation Solid)

#### Tier 1: Safe & Steady
- **Livret A** — Tax-free, guaranteed (€22,950 max)
- **LDDS** — Similar (€12,000 max)
- **Assurance Vie** — Tax advantages after 8 years

#### Tier 2: Moderate Growth
- **PEA** (Plan d'Épargne en Actions) — Tax-advantaged stock investing
- **ETFs** — Diversified, low-cost (MSCI World, S&P 500)
- **SCPI** — Real estate without buying property

#### Tier 3: Higher Risk/Reward
- **Individual stocks** — Only with research
- **Crypto** — Small allocation (5-10% max)

### House Purchase Strategy (France)

**Requirements:**
- 10-20% down payment + fees (~8% notary fees)
- Stable income proof (3 years tax returns if self-employed)
- Debt ratio under 35%

**For €300,000 house:**
- Down payment: €30,000-60,000
- Notary fees: ~€24,000
- Total needed: €54,000-84,000

**Timeline to save €60,000:**
| Monthly Savings | Time Needed |
|-----------------|-------------|
| €500 | 10 years |
| €1,000 | 5 years |
| €2,000 | 2.5 years |
| €3,000 | 1.7 years |

### Automated Trading Considerations

**Reality Check:**
- Most retail algo traders lose money
- Markets are extremely competitive
- Requires significant capital and expertise

**Safer Approach:**
- Dollar-cost averaging (automatic monthly investments)
- Index funds (beats most active traders)
- Focus on earning more (business) vs. trading more

# CLOSING THOUGHTS

Kabundji, you have an exceptional skill set. The market needs what you offer. The challenge isn't capability — it's focus and execution.

My recommendation: **Pick ONE business line and dominate it before expanding.**

If I had to choose for you based on everything you've told me:

**Start with Architecture Visualization in Paris.**

Why?
- Immediate income potential
- Leverages your strongest technical skills
- Clear market with identifiable clients
- Can be done alongside building other systems
- Establishes credibility for AI consulting later

Everything else (YouTube, LinkedIn, AI business) supports this primary focus.
