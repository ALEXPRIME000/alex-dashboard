## 04:17 UTC - Cost Optimization Implementation

**Request:** Implement Claudebot cost optimization guide + research Sonnet 5

### Actions Taken

1. **Researched Claude Sonnet 5 "Fennec"**
   - Leaked via Vertex AI logs: `claude-sonnet-5@20260203`
   - May launch TODAY (Feb 3, 2026)
   - Rumored: 50% cheaper than Opus, same/better performance
   - Created `docs/SONNET5-RESEARCH.md`

2. **Implemented Cost Optimizations**
   - ✅ Heartbeat model: Opus → Haiku 4 (80% cheaper)
   - ✅ Heartbeat interval: 10s → 1 hour (360x fewer calls)
   - ✅ Subagent model: Opus → Kimi K2.5 (FREE)
   - ✅ Added model aliases: opus, sonnet, haiku, kimi, groq

3. **Config Applied**
   - Gateway restarted with new settings
   - Estimated savings: $100-200+/month

### Files Modified
- `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (config)
- `docs/MODEL-ALLOCATION.md` (updated)
- `docs/SONNET5-RESEARCH.md` (created)

### Next Steps
- Monitor for official Sonnet 5 announcement
- Add Sonnet 5 to config when available
- Consider Sonnet 5 as primary if performance matches Opus
