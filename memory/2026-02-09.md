## Session Start
- Fresh session after OpenClaw re-onboard (version 2026.2.6-3)
- Model: Claude Opus 4.6
- WhatsApp connected

## Events
- **04:09** — Kabundji checked in, asked what version I am
- **04:10** — Confirmed I'm up and running
- **04:50** — Heartbeat failed with error: `Unknown model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4`
  - Root cause: `haiku` alias in config pointed to non-existent model
  - Fix: Changed heartbeat model from `anthropic/claude-haiku-4` → `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
  - Gateway restarted successfully
- **04:50** — First successful heartbeat after fix, dashboard updated

## Notes
