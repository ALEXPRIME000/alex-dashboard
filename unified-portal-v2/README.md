# Design Rationale
The redesigned Unified Portal for Kabundji is based on the Architectural Luxe aesthetic movement. This design philosophy combines the principles of architecture and editorial design to create a clean, minimalist, and luxurious visual experience.
## Key Design Elements
* Space and form: Clean lines, minimalism
* Color and material: Dark blues, whites, and wood textures
* Scale and rhythm: Large typography, generous margins
* Composition: Swiss grid system
* Visual hierarchy: Clear typography, intuitive navigation
The design features a dark theme with subtle animations and transitions, creating a sense of sophistication and elegance. The company cards are designed as individual masterpieces, each with its own unique character and personality.

The portal is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a custom stylesheet to ensure a consistent and cohesive design language throughout the application.
