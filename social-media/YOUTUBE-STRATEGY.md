## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Inconsistent Uploads:** Algorithm punishes irregularity. Set realistic frequency.
2. **Clickbait Thumbnails:** High CTR but low AVD = algorithm suppression
3. **No Hook:** First 10 seconds decide if people stay. Make them count.
4. **Too Long:** 20 min tutorial should be 10 min. Respect viewer time.
5. **Ignoring SEO:** Great video, no views = no keyword optimization
6. **No CTA:** Tell viewers what to do next (subscribe, check link, comment)
7. **Talking Too Fast:** Slow down, especially for tutorials
8. **No Subtitles:** 70% watch muted. Add captions.

---
