(Vote + share your thoughts below)
```

**Alternative (Hot Take Text):**
```
Unpopular opinion: Your website doesn't need to be "perfect."

It needs to WORK.

I see too many founders obsessing over:
• The perfect color palette
• Every pixel aligned
• Animations on everything

Meanwhile, their site loads in 8 seconds and converts at 0.5%.

Here's the truth: [Continue with insight]

Ship fast. Iterate. Obsess over results, not perfection.

Agree or disagree? 🔥

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Posting and Ghosting:** Post without engagement = wasted effort
2. **Selling Too Soon:** Provide value for 3-5 touches before pitching
3. **Generic Outreach:** "Let's connect!" = ignored. Be specific.
4. **Ignoring Analytics:** Post blindly vs. double down on what works
5. **No CTA:** Every post needs a next step (comment, DM, click, save)
6. **Inconsistent Branding:** Random topics confuse the algorithm and audience
7. **Link Dumping:** External links kill reach. Native content first.
8. **No Face:** People buy from people. Show Chicco's personality.
