## 🎵 TRENDING AUDIO STRATEGY

- TikTok shows your video to people who engaged with that sound before
- Audio creates emotional connection + memorability

### How to Find Trending Audio
1. Scroll FYP daily, save sounds you like
2. Check "Trending" in TikTok Sounds library
3. Look for songs with 10K-100K uses (sweet spot: not oversaturated yet)
4. Use TokBoard.com or Toklytics for trending sound alerts

### Audio Categories to Use

**1. Trending Music (40%)**
- Pop hits, remixes, viral songs
- Example: "Cupid" by Fifty Fifty, "Flowers" by Miley

**2. Viral Sound Bites (30%)**
- Memes, movie clips, podcast snippets
- Example: "Oh no, oh no, oh no no no" (overused now, but illustrates concept)

**3. Voiceover Trends (20%)**
- "POV" sounds, storytelling formats
- People talking about relatable situations

**4. Original Audio (10%)**
- Your own voice, explanations
- Can go viral if unique/valuable
- Allows others to use your sound (brand awareness)

### Audio Selection Checklist
- [ ] Is it trending (10K+ uses in last 7 days)?
- [ ] Does it fit the vibe of my content?
- [ ] Is it the right length for my video?
- [ ] Can I loop it seamlessly if needed?
- [ ] Is it copyright-safe (no strikes)?

## 💡 ADVANCED TACTICS

### Tactic 1: The "Hook Test" Method
**Problem:** You don't know which hook will perform best
**Solution:** Post the SAME video with 3 different hooks (different days)

**Example:**
- Video: Before/after website redesign
- Hook A: "This website cost €20,000 👇"
- Hook B: "POV: You hire a professional designer"
- Hook C: "Watch me redesign this site in 60 seconds"

Post all three over one week. Winner gets scaled (repost with slight variations).

### Tactic 2: Comment-to-Content Pipeline
**How it works:**
1. Someone asks a question in comments
2. Reply: "Great question! Making a video on this tomorrow. Make sure you're following!"
3. Create video answering that question
4. Tag the person who asked in caption
5. They share = free promotion

**Benefit:** Endless content ideas + guaranteed engagement (person who asked + their network).

### Tactic 3: The "Series" Strategy
**Format:** Multi-part videos that create binge-watching

**Examples:**
- "Redesigning bad websites: Day 1/30"
- "I'm designing a website live: Part 1"
- "Teaching my [friend/family] design: Episode 1"

**Why it works:**
- People follow to see next part
- Algorithm recognizes series, pushes all parts
- Builds anticipation

**Pro Tip:** Film all parts in advance, post consistently (daily or every other day).

### Tactic 4: Duet Challenges
**Create a challenge for your audience:**

**Example:**
"Show me your logo design and I'll rate it 1-10"
→ People Duet your video with their logo
→ You react/rate in another video
→ They share their feature
→ Free content + reach

**Other Challenge Ideas:**
- "Send me your website, I'll roast it (constructively)"
- "Designers, show me your workspace setup"
- "What font is this? Wrong answers only" (meme format)

### Tactic 5: Cross-Platform Repurposing
**TikTok → YouTube Shorts → Instagram Reels → Twitter**

Same video, posted on all platforms = 4x reach.

**Tool:** Repurpose.io or Buffer to schedule across platforms

**Adaptation Tips:**
- TikTok: Trending audio, fast-paced
- YouTube Shorts: Slightly longer, more context
- Instagram Reels: Polished, aesthetic
- Twitter: Add text thread below video

### Tactic 6: Behind-the-Scenes of Going Viral
**When a video hits 100K+ views:**
- Create follow-up: "This video got 500K views. Here's why it worked 👇"
- Breakdown: Hook, audio choice, timing, topic
- Teaches audience + positions you as expert
- Meta-content (content about content) performs well

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Posting Inconsistently
**Problem:** Post 7 videos one week, then nothing for 2 weeks
**Solution:** Batch film content, schedule in advance, maintain rhythm

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Trends
**Problem:** Only post what YOU want, ignore what's trending
**Solution:** 70% your content, 30% trending/viral attempts

### Mistake 3: No Hook
**Problem:** Video starts with "Hey guys, today I'm going to..."
**Solution:** Start with the value. "This trick saved me 10 hours 👇"

### Mistake 4: Too Polished
**Problem:** Overproduced, looks like an ad
**Solution:** TikTok favors authentic. Phone camera, natural light = enough.

### Mistake 5: Not Responding to Comments
**Problem:** Post and ghost
**Solution:** Reply to every comment in first 2-4 hours (boosts algorithm)

### Mistake 6: Forgetting Captions
**Problem:** No text overlays or subtitles
**Solution:** 70% watch muted. Add captions to EVERY video.

### Mistake 7: External Links Too Soon
**Problem:** "Link in bio" when you have 50 followers
**Solution:** Build audience first (500+), then monetize.

### Mistake 8: Giving Up Too Early
**Problem:** Post 10 videos, get 200 views each, quit
**Solution:** Viral growth is exponential. Video #47 might be your breakout.
